<p>A plotly visualization is composed of one (or more) trace(s), and every trace has a <code>type</code> (the default type is ‘scatter’). The arguments/properties that a trace will respect (<a href="https://plot.ly/r/reference">documented here</a>) depend on it’s type. A scatter trace respects <code>mode</code>, which can be any combination of “lines”, “markers”, “text” joined with a “+”:</p>

<p>Although these functions output special “plotly data frames”, <code>plot_ly()</code> doesn’t require a data frame for input. This makes chart types that accept a <code>z</code> argument especially easy to use if you have a numeric matrix:</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/">a free plotly account</a>, <code>plotly_POST()</code> makes it easy to host/share any plotly figure (click on the image below to see the interactive version).</p>

<h2>Special arguments</h2>
<p>The <strong>plotly</strong> function arguments used thus far are documented in <a href="https://plot.ly/r/reference">the figure reference</a>, but there are a handful of additional arguments not described in the reference that make common visualizations a bit easier. These arguments are very much inspired by the semantics of ggplot2’s <code>qplot()</code> in the sense that a scales are automatically applied these variables.</p>

<h4>Qualitative color mappings</h4>
<p>If a ordinal variable (aka a non-ordered factor variable) is assigned to color, then a qualitative color palette is used by default.</p>
