Removed the stream() function as it wasn't ready to be included.

1.0.0 -- 31 July 2015

A major reworking of package internals which includes a few backwards incompatible changes.

Major changes include:

(1) New high-level grammar for expressing Plotly graphs from R (see the `plot_ly()`, `add_trace()`, `layout()`, and `style()` functions).
(2) New print methods which make it easier to create, modify, and embed Plotly graphs.
(3) Added a `subplot()` function for putting several graphs on a single page.
(4) Added the `renderPlotly()` and `plotlyOutput()` functions for embedding plotly graphs in shiny applications.
(5) Added `offline()` function for creating standalone HTML pages via Plotly Offline (see http://purchasing.plot.ly/)
