\description{
For convenience and efficiency purposes, plotly objects are subject to lazy 
evaluation. That is, the actual content behind a plotly object is not 
created until it is absolutely necessary. In some instances, you may want 
to perform this evaluation yourself, and work directly with the resulting 
list.
